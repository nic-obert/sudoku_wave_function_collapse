Project Description

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] debug the bruteforce backtracking algorithm to see why it sometimes gets stuck. Maybe it's just bad luck that the algorithm is getting everything wrong  
- [ ] use the bruteforce backtracking algorithm to count the number of solutions to generate a board with a unique solution  
- [ ] Eventually, implement a more efficient sudoku generation algorithm that doesn't involve brute-force generation. Now the average successful generation rate is around 26%  

### In Progress

- [ ] write a good readme  

### Done âœ“

- [x] rewrite the serde interface  
- [x] Implement solver that analyzes wave functions and intersects them  
- [x] Add the possiblity to save and load boards from/to a file  
- [x] implement brute force solver (still uses wave functions)  
- [x] divide the code into multiple files
